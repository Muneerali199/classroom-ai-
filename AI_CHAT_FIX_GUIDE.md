# AI Chat Fix Guide

## Issue Diagnosis

The AI assistant was failing with a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to respond to messages. The root cause was:

### Error Message
```
Error fetching user data: {
  code: 'PGRST116',
  details: 'The result contains 0 rows',
  hint: null,
  message: 'Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object'
}
POST /api/ai-chat 500 in 12832ms
```

### Root Cause
The AI data service was trying to fetch user profile data from the `students` or `teachers` table using the `auth_user_id` field, but **the user doesn't have a profile record yet** in the database.

When you're logged in as a teacher (auth_user_id: `561e5eda-ec59-4267-84d7-16c084b50965`), the system tried to find a teacher record with that ID, but it doesn't exist in the `teachers` table.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced fetchUserInfo Function
**File**: `src/lib/ai-data-service.ts`

Changed the function to handle missing user profiles gracefully:

```typescript
async function fetchUserInfo(userId: string, userRole: string) {
  const tableName = userRole === 'student' ? 'students' : 'teachers';
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from(tableName)
    .select('*')
    .eq('auth_user_id', userId)
    .single();

  // If no user record found, return minimal data with userId
  if (error || !data) {
    console.log(`No ${userRole} record found for auth_user_id: ${userId}, using minimal profile`);
    return {
      id: userId,
      auth_user_id: userId,
      name: 'User',
      email: '',
      role: userRole
    };
  }
  return data;
}
```

**What it does**: Instead of throwing an error when no user record is found, it now returns a minimal user profile with basic information.

### 2. Enhanced fetchCompleteUserData Function
**File**: `src/lib/ai-data-service.ts`

Added fallback data structure if data fetching fails:

```typescript
export async function fetchCompleteUserData(
  userId: string,
  userRole: 'student' | 'teacher' | 'dean'
): Promise<UserPerformanceData> {
  try {
    // ... existing code ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    
    // Return minimal data structure if fetch fails
    return {
      userId,
      userRole,
      userInfo: { id: userId, name: 'User', role: userRole },
      academicYear,
      semester,
      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
      performanceTrend: 'stable',
      riskLevel: 'low'
    };
  }
}
```

**What it does**: If any error occurs during data fetching, return a minimal but valid data structure so the AI can still respond.

### 3. Updated System Instructions
**File**: `src/lib/ai-engine.ts`

Modified AI instructions to handle limited data:

```typescript
Response Guidelines:
- If user data is limited or unavailable, acknowledge it and provide general helpful advice
- When discussing performance, be specific (use percentages, numbers, etc.) when data is available
```

**What it does**: The AI now knows to provide general helpful advice when user data is limited.

## Why This Happened

Your authentication system creates auth users in Supabase Auth, but it doesn't automatically create corresponding records in the `students` or `teachers` tables. This can happen when:

1. **Manual user creation**: Users created directly in Supabase Auth without running the `create_user_account` function
2. **Migration issues**: Users existed before the migration that added `auth_user_id` field
3. **Incomplete registration**: Registration process didn't complete the profile creation step
4. **Admin/Dean accounts**: Dean or admin accounts that don't have corresponding teacher records

## How to Fix Existing Users

### Option 1: Create Missing Teacher Record
If you're logged in as a teacher but don't have a teacher record:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO teachers (
  auth_user_id,
  name,
  email,
  created_at
)
SELECT 
  id as auth_user_id,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name' as name,
  email,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE id = '561e5eda-ec59-4267-84d7-16c084b50965' -- Replace with your auth_user_id
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM teachers WHERE auth_user_id = auth.users.id
  );
```

### Option 2: Create All Missing Teacher Records
To create teacher records for all auth users that don't have one:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO teachers (
  auth_user_id,
  name,
  email,
  created_at
)
SELECT 
  u.id as auth_user_id,
  COALESCE(u.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', u.email) as name,
  u.email,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM auth.users u
WHERE u.raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'teacher'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM teachers t WHERE t.auth_user_id = u.id
  );
```

### Option 3: Create Missing Student Records
For students without records:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO students (
  id,
  auth_user_id,
  name,
  email,
  created_at
)
SELECT 
  u.id::text as id,
  u.id as auth_user_id,
  COALESCE(u.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', u.email) as name,
  u.email,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM auth.users u
WHERE u.raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'student'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM students s WHERE s.auth_user_id = u.id
  );
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test with Limited Profile
The AI should now work even if you don't have a complete profile. Try:
- Navigate to `/dashboard/assistant` (teacher dashboard)
- Send a message: "Hello, can you help me?"
- The AI should respond with general helpful advice

### 2. Test After Creating Profile
After running the SQL to create your teacher record:
1. Refresh the AI assistant page
2. The AI should now have access to your full profile data
3. It will provide more personalized responses

### 3. Check Console Logs
Look for these messages in the terminal:
```
[AI Chat] Processing chat request for user [userId] (teacher)
No teacher record found for auth_user_id: [userId], using minimal profile
[AI Chat] User data fetched successfully
[AI Chat] Response generated successfully
```

## Long-term Solution

To prevent this issue in the future, ensure that:

1. **Use the create_user_account function** when creating new users (available in migrations/007)
2. **Add validation** in your registration flow to ensure profile records are created
3. **Create a migration** to sync existing auth users with their profile tables
4. **Add monitoring** to alert when users have auth accounts but no profile records

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Fixed**: AI data service handles missing profiles gracefully
‚úÖ **Fixed**: AI engine provides general advice when data is limited
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Error handling returns minimal valid data instead of crashing
‚úÖ **Working**: AI assistant can respond to messages even without full user data
‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Needed**: Create profile records for existing users (run SQL above)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Needed**: Ensure future user creation includes profile records

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** for AI conversations table (if not done):
   ```sql
   -- migrations/020_create_ai_conversations_table.sql
   ```

2. **Create your teacher profile** using Option 1 SQL above

3. **Add your Google Gemini API key** to `.env` file:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Test the AI assistant** after creating your profile

5. **Consider running** Option 2 or 3 SQL to create records for all users

## Support

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal console for detailed error logs
2. Verify your Supabase connection is working
3. Confirm the Google Gemini API key is valid
4. Check that the database migration (020) has been run
5. Ensure your auth user has the correct role metadata

The AI should now respond gracefully whether or not you have a complete profile! üéâ
