# Database Migration Instructions

## ‚úÖ Assignments Table Setup

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

Navigate to your Supabase Dashboard and execute the migration script:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Open the migration file: `migrations/014_create_assignments_table.sql`
3. Copy the entire content and paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

This will create:
- ‚úÖ `assignments` table
- ‚úÖ `assignment_submissions` table  
- ‚úÖ `student_notifications` table
- ‚úÖ All necessary indexes and triggers
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ‚úÖ Views for assignment statistics

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

Create the storage bucket for assignment files:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Name**: `assignments`
   - **Public**: Uncheck (keep it private)
   - Click **Create Bucket**

### Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, set up access policies:

1. Click on the `assignments` bucket
2. Go to **Policies** tab
3. Add the following policies:

#### Policy 1: Teachers Upload Files
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Teachers upload assignment files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'assignments' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
        WHERE auth.uid() = id
        AND (raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'teacher' OR raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'dean')
    )
);
```

#### Policy 2: Authenticated Users View Files
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users view assignment files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'assignments' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

#### Policy 3: Students Upload Submission Files
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Students upload submission files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'assignments' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
        WHERE auth.uid() = id
        AND raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'student'
    )
);
```

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

Run this query to verify all tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('assignments', 'assignment_submissions', 'student_notifications');
```

Expected output: 3 rows

### Step 5: Test the Assignment Creation

1. Log in to your application as a **Teacher**
2. Navigate to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Assignments**
3. Try creating a test assignment with:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Due Date
   - Subject (optional)
   - File attachment (optional)
4. Click **Publish Assignment**

If successful, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Assignment created successfully
- ‚úÖ Students notified (toast message)
- ‚úÖ Assignment appears in the list

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: "relation 'public.assignments' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the migration script in Step 1

#### Error: "Bucket not found"
**Solution**: Create the storage bucket in Step 2

#### Error: "Failed to fetch students" or "Failed to create notifications"
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure the `students` table exists
2. Check if you have any students in your database
3. Verify RLS policies allow the operation

#### Error: "Permission denied for table assignments"
**Solution**: Check RLS policies and ensure your user role is correctly set
