## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### The Last UUID Error Location:

**In the students table query:**

```sql
-- BEFORE (caused UUID = text error):
WHERE auth_user_id = current_user_id()

-- AFTER (fixed with ::text cast):
WHERE auth_user_id::text = current_user_id()
```

This was in the "Students view enrollments" policy on line 117.

## 📋 All UUID Comparisons Fixed:

1. ✅ Helper functions - use JWT token (no database query)
2. ✅ Timetable policies - use `current_user_id()` function
3. ✅ Meeting policies - use `current_user_id()` function
4. ✅ Students table query - cast to `::text`
5. ✅ Teachers table policies - cast both sides to `::text`
6. ✅ Storage policies - use `auth.role()` instead of UUID
