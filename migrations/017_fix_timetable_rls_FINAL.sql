-- Create simplified, working RLS policies for timetables

-- 1. Teachers can INSERT their own timetables
CREATE POLICY "Teachers insert own timetables" ON public.timetables
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        teacher_id = (auth.uid())::text 
        AND created_by = (auth.uid())::text
        AND (
            SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role') IN ('teacher', 'dean')
            FROM auth.users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- 2. Teachers can SELECT their own timetables
CREATE POLICY "Teachers view own timetables" ON public.timetables
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        teacher_id = (auth.uid())::text 
        OR created_by = (auth.uid())::text
        OR (
            SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role') = 'dean'
            FROM auth.users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- 3. Teachers can UPDATE their own timetables
CREATE POLICY "Teachers update own timetables" ON public.timetables
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (
        teacher_id = (auth.uid())::text 
        OR created_by = (auth.uid())::text
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        teacher_id = (auth.uid())::text 
        OR created_by = (auth.uid())::text
    );

-- 4. Teachers can DELETE their own timetables
CREATE POLICY "Teachers delete own timetables" ON public.timetables
    FOR DELETE 
    USING (
        teacher_id = (auth.uid())::text 
        OR created_by = (auth.uid())::text
    );

-- 5. Students can view all active timetables
CREATE POLICY "Students view active timetables" ON public.timetables
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        is_active = true 
        AND (
            SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role') = 'student'
            FROM auth.users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Update timetable_students policies

-- Teachers can manage all enrollments
CREATE POLICY "Teachers manage enrollments" ON public.timetable_students
    FOR ALL 
    USING (
        (
            SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role') IN ('teacher', 'dean')
            FROM auth.users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        (
            SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role') IN ('teacher', 'dean')
            FROM auth.users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Students can view their own enrollments
CREATE POLICY "Students view enrollments" ON public.timetable_students
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM students 
            WHERE auth_user_id = (auth.uid())::text
            AND id = timetable_students.student_id
        )
    );
